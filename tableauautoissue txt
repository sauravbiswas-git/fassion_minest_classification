When using the Tableau REST API to export dashboard images (/views/{view_id}/image), Tableau can serve cached images, especially when you're applying filters via the query string (vf_<filter_name>). This often leads to:

Old or stale data showing up.

Filters being ignored silently in the exported image.




the /views/{view_id}/image endpoint does not always re-render the view, even with cache-busting tricks like timestamps. It often returns cached images that don’t reflect recent extract refreshes or live connection updates.
Why this happens
Tableau’s REST API image and previewImage endpoints often serve from vizql-server cache.

They do not trigger full viz rendering like the actual Tableau frontend.

Even with vf_ filters and cache-busting query params, Tableau may still pull stale content.
